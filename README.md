# WP6-navigation-analysis

The project contains R scripts for analyzing and visualizing behavioral spatial navigation and neuropsychological data. 
We compared cognition in neurological patients with amyotrophic lateral scleroris (ALS) and healthy controls.
The results are published in Maier, Iggena et al. (2023) Memory-guided navigation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

As navigation task, we used a variant of the Starmaze (Igloi, 2009; Rondi-Reig, 2006; Iggena, 2022).
Here, participants navigate through a star-shaped, symmetrical maze, searching for a goal location. 
We assess egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (world-centered) spatial navigation in multiple condition and integrated neuropsychological, clinical and demographical data.
