# WP6-navigation-analysis

The project contains R scripts for analyzing and visualizing behavioral spatial navigation and neuropsychological data. 
We compared cognition in neurological patients with amyotrophic lateral scleroris (ALS) and healthy controls. 

As navigation task, we used a variant of the Starmaze (Igloi, 2009; Rondi-Reig, 2006; Iggena, 2022).
Here, participants navigate through a star-shaped, symmetrical maze, searching for a goal location. 
We assess egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (world-centered) spatial navigation in multiple condition and integrated neuropsychological, clinical and demographical data.
